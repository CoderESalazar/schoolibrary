	<related-content>Hello and welcome to this two part video on using persistent links for your course resources page. Persistent links are links that take students directly to articles from outside the database. This is great way for you to make information available without having the student search for the article. Persistent links will also work from your course resources area, email account and/or word processor.     To get started you might want to begin at the NCU Databases page or the Find an Article page in the NCU Library. Keep in mind that only ProQuest, FirstSearch and EBSCOHost offer persistent link. For CSA, please see the Persistent Links Worksheet for more information.   </related-content>

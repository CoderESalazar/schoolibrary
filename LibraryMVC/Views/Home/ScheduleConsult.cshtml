    Schedule a Research Consultation
</h2>
<p>
    The NCU Library offers a research consultation service for students, faculty, and
    staff. This is an in-depth, customized, one-on-one meeting with a reference librarian
    to discuss possible information resources and search strategies for class assignments,
    papers, presentations, Masters theses, and doctoral dissertations.

<strong>Research Consultation Policies</strong>
<ol>
    <li>
        This service is available to NCU students, faculty and staff. <strong>
            However, we are unable to schedule consultations with students who are currently taking their
            comprehensive exam course nor can we provide any assistance, advice, or preparation
            related to the comprehensive exam course.
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Consultations are scheduled during <a href="/dw/index/22" target="_blank" style="color: darkblue;">normal operating hours</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requests must be made at least 3 business days in advance to allow time for the
        librarian to prepare. <b>You may have only one consultation scheduled at any one time.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once your request is received, a librarian will contact you within 24 hours (excluding
        weekends and holidays) to schedule your appointment.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is expected that you review the <a target="_blank" href="/dw/index/179">
            Research
            Process
        </a> prior to your scheduled consultation.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is expected that you will meet your appointment time, or contact us within
        a reasonable time period to cancel. The Library relies on the punctuality and consistency
        of students in order to continue providing the Research Consultation service. Repeated
        cancellations and "no shows" may result in suspension of scheduling privileges.
    </li>
    <li>
        The reference librarians will not do the actual research for you, nor will they
        answer questions that a professor has assigned as part of a class activity.
    </li>
    <li>
        The reference librarians may not help you with the mechanics and style of writing
        a research paper. You are advised to contact the Writing Center for assistance at asc@ncu.edu or 888-327-2877 ext. 8052.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consultations take place through GoToMeeting, the Library’s online meeting software.
        Once the meeting time is confirmed, you will be sent a meeting invitation containing
        access and call-in information. <strong>
            IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK YOUR EMAIL
            FOR THE MEETING INVITATION.
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>You will be asked to complete a satisfaction survey following the consultation session.</li>
    <li><strong>The Library reserves the right to refuse this service.</strong></li>
